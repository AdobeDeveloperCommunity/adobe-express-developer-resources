# Contributing

Thanks for your help! We welcome any contributions that can help other developers building or learning to build add-ons.

To add an entry that links to a published resource (i.e. YouTube, npm package, article):

- Edit the `README.md` file and add a bullet to the relevant section
  - Add new section if needed
- Use the following format:
    ```
    - [Title of resource](https://example.com/link-to-resource) - Short description of resource
    ```

To add an entry that is _stored in this repo_ (i.e. samples, demos):
